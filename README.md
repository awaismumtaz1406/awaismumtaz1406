About me,
I’m currently working on C++ programs focused on object-oriented programming, logic building, and academic software engineering projects, while also exploring front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I’m looking to collaborate on beginner to intermediate C++ projects, problem-solving tasks, academic assignments, and front-end web applications, including interactive websites and UI/UX improvements.

I’m seeking guidance in optimizing C++ code, advanced OOP concepts, data structures, and front-end best practices such as responsive design, React state management, and performance optimization.

I’m currently learning data structures in C++, DBMS concepts, core computer science fundamentals, and modern front-end frameworks. Additionally, I am building my Python skills for AI, focusing on logic, data handling, and basic machine learning concepts, aiming to combine Python and AI with front-end development to create practical, real-world solutions step by step.
